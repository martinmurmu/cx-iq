SOME NOTES FOR APP MAINTAIN, DEPLOY

APP STRUCTURE

App uses java application to build reports, that app is executed by background worker.
Ferret server is used for autocomplete in some dropdown lists (seems started automatically on reboot)

BACKGROUND WORKER

reports are produced in background, to start background worker:
"cd /home/production/amplifiedanalytics.com/current;RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job restart"
This command is executed automatically on reboot with root cron (@reboot command).

It should be started by "production" user (in theory), but for some reason (permission problems)
it doesn't work this way, so should be started by "root".

If some report build code was changed worker isn't restarted by capistrano (deploy script)
automatically, so should be restarted manually.
