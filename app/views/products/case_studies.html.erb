    	  As a Product Manager in Consumer Electronics industry, I used to spend
 countless hours parsing demographics and research data with market
 researchers on our team. Key metrics involving my product vs. its direct
 competition are critical for forecasting product success and assessing how
 to secure it. Historically, we had made most of our decisions based on
 assumptions with very little direct evidence. Since finding Customer
 Experience IQ, however, we have been able to use their Market Intelligence
 Analysis to get the exact information we need— what people who spend their
 money on products like ours have to say about their experiences. These
 specific measurements make it very easy for me and my team to focus on
 critical information. The cost savings, too, are staggering, as we’ve been
 able to shed hundreds of man hours in the process. Plus, we get the
 research results within 24 hours— it used to take us 3-4 times longer just
 to initiate a survey.  Customer Experience IQ is win-win for us— it provides
 us with the reliable feedback from customer analysis that we need to grow
 our customer base and pick off the competition, while saving us time and
 money.

    	<p style="width: 480px; top: 101px;">As a B2B Software Manufacturer who sources most of our leads through our
 website, we are obviously concerned about how visitors to our site feel
 about it. We used to ask customers to give us their feedback through
 online surveys, but the results were not very useful or dynamic— some
 customers would leave a few comments, but most just would rate and score
 our questions as asked. We really wanted to establish a meaningful
 dialogue with them as individual users of our software. Like many
 businesses, we had also tried a customer forum; however, all the survey
 comments, forum communications and even our sales force notes could not
 help us to parse any actionable insights out of the endless chatter and
 stories. That is, until we found Customer Experience IQ and their Customer
 Intelligence Analysis software tool. CI analysis was just the solution we
 needed to help cull clear signals and data out of all the “noise”. Now, we
 encourage customers on our website to tell their stories as elaborately as
 they want and in their own words. We use the Customer Intelligence we
 gather to help us manage our release scopes and schedules based on this
 detailed customer feedback. We are even considering publishing a CI
 analysis summary and an associated next release plan, so that our
 customers can see that their voice is truly driving our decisions.
 Working with Customer Experience IQ has really enhanced our dialogue with
 customers and helped us perfect our offerings.</p>

    	<p style="width: 480px;">Having run 2 high-end restaurants in San Jose successfully, I decided to
 court some new, potential investors with the hopes of opening a third
 restaurant in a new part of the city. The catch was that this time around
 the investors predicated funding on my developing a concise business plan.
 Since I had little experience with market research, I needed to outsource
 the work. Unfortunately, most bids I received were prohibitively expensive
 or entirely generic in their approach. Then one of my investors turned me
 on to online customer opinion mining and I found Customer Experience IQ. From
 go, they were right on target— they didn’t need me to come up with
 assumptions about the profile or demographics of my target market.
 Instead, I just gave them the names of 3 or 4 successful restaurants in my
 niche to use as reference. Customer Experience IQ was then able to use this
 information to source detailed information on my contemporaries  online
 that I used to create a roadmap for my new venture. It was a seamless and
 elegant solution to my problem— the results were in my hands in a matter
 of days and the cost was 20% below the lowest quote I had received from
 other vendors. We’ve been open now for 5 months and I can safely say that
 I have never experienced such a fast ramp-up after launching a restaurant.
