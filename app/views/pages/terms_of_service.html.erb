          </p>


          <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>2. SERVICES.</b><br />
2.1. Subject to Your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, Customer
Experience IQ will provide access to the Services, as described more fully on the Site, solely for Your
own internal business purposes (and not for the use or benefit of any third party) and subject to
any restrictions in Your Order, including access and use by the number of Seats identified in
Your Order. Customer Experience IQ reserves the right to modify or discontinue any aspect of the
Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content and/or
impose limits on certain features and services and/or restrict Your access to parts of the Services
by providing You with prior notice. In the event of a material modification or discontinuance

2.2. Customer Experience IQ may periodically upgrade or enhance the Services at any time without

          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>3. TERM.</b><br />
Your Subscription to the Services will be in effect for the time period set forth in Your
applicable Order (the &ldquo;Subscription Term&rdquo;), which will automatically renew for additional
Subscription Terms of the same duration unless either party provides notice of its intention not to
renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term.
Notification of non-renewal for monthly online orders may be given on or before each monthly
billing cycle anniversary date. Any renewal Subscription Term is subject to the payment of the
applicable renewal fees, if any, 30 days prior to the start of the next Subscription Term (or other
period as set forth on the Order). Customer Experience IQ reserves the right to change the applicable
fees or charges and to institute new charges and fees at the end of the initial Subscription Term
or then current renewal Subscription Term upon 60 days prior notice to You (which may be sent
by email). Failure to pay the applicable renewal fees will result in automatic revocation and
termination of the Services and all rights and licenses granted hereunder at the end of the existing
Subscription Term.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>4. FEES AND PAYMENT.</b><br />
You shall pay to Customer Experience IQ the applicable fees for the Services. Fees are due and
payable at the beginning of the Subscription Term or in accordance with Your Order. If You
provide credit card information to Customer Experience IQ, You authorize Customer Experience IQ to
bill such credit card at the time You order any Services, for all Services set forth in the Order,
and at the time of any renewal, for the amount charged for any renewal Subscription Term(s). If
You did not pay by credit card, Customer Experience IQ shall bill You through invoice, in which
case payment is due 30 days from the invoice date or as described in Your Order. Delinquent
payments are subject to late payment fees equivalent to 1.5% of the overdue balance per month
(or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower), plus any expenses associated with
collections. Payments must be made in US dollars. Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, and
duties imposed by taxing authorities, and You are responsible for all such taxes, excluding taxes
based solely on Customer Experience IQ&rsquo;s income. If and when additional Seats are added to Your
account, You will be invoiced for such additional Seats, which will be prorated for the balance of
the then-current Subscription Term. Any billing disputes must be reported to Customer
Experience IQ in writing within 60 days of the date of the invoice. All fees paid are non-refundable. If
Your account is 30 days or more overdue (except with respect to fees or charges for which there
is a reasonable and good faith dispute), Customer Experience IQ reserves the right to suspend the
Services without liability until such amounts are paid in full, in addition to any of its other rights
or remedies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

As used herein, &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means all confidential and proprietary information of
a party (&ldquo;Disclosing Party&rdquo;) disclosed to the other party (&ldquo;Receiving Party&rdquo;), whether orally or in
writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be
confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including pricing and other terms reflected in all
Order Forms hereunder), Customer Data, the Services, Content, business and marketing plans,
technology and technical information, product designs, and business processes. The Receiving
Party shall not disclose or use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any
purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, except with the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s prior written
permission. Confidential Information (except Customer Data) shall not include any information

Customer Experience IQ and/or its licensors own all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the
Services and the Content, in any form, format, forum, medium, means, or method now known or
hereafter developed, including all related intellectual property rights throughout the world, and
any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations that may be provided

Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon 30 days written notice of a material
breach to the other party if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period.
Customer Experience IQ may immediately suspend access to or terminate the Services if Customer
Experience IQ reasonably determines that Your actions are interfering with or disrupting the integrity
or performance of the Services or are likely to cause legal liability for Customer Experience IQ or its
licensors or other customers. Further, with respect to the SalesView Free version of the Services,
either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>10. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION.</b><br />
Upon any expiration or termination of the Subscription Term or the Agreement, the rights and
licenses granted hereunder will automatically terminate, and You may not continue to use the
Services. Termination shall not relieve You of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or payable
to Customer Experience IQ under the Agreement or applicable Order. The provisions of Sections 3
through 14 will survive termination. Customer Experience IQ is under no obligation to retain
Customer Data on expiration of the Subscription Term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>11. DISCLAIMER.</b><br />
Customer Experience IQ is not responsible or liable for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality,

<p style="text-align: justify;">
        	<b>12. INDEMNITY.</b><br />
Customer Experience IQ will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless from and against any finally
